# Account related requests

This chapter will guide you through the process of retrieving account information from a NEM Infrastructure Server. The information that can be retrieved is the durable account data, its meta data and information about transactions and harvested blocks.

NIS supports two different kind of accounts: normal accounts and multsig (short for: multi signature) accounts:

**Normal accounts:**

Normal accounts are created and controlled by a private key. Any action for the account like sending NEM to another account via a transfer transaction is signed with this private key. If an attacker gains knowledge of the private key, he/she can rob the account. The private key must therefore be kept secret by all means.

**Multisig accounts:**

Multisig accounts can be created by converting a normal account to a multisig account via a aggregate modification transaction. This adds cosignatories to the account. After that modification, only the cosignatories can initiate an action for the account. Any action must be signed by all cosignatories. This makes a multisig account significantly more secure than a normal account. When a single cosignatory private key is gained by an attacker, the attacker still can`t initiate any action on the account since all cosignatories must sign. It is strongly recommended to convert any account holding a significantly high amount of NEM into a multisig account with at least 3 cosignatories. Once converted to a multisig account, the original private key for the account plays no role any more.

## Keypair concept

NEM Library replaces the Keypair model, which usually holds the public and private key, with the [Account](#account) model. The reason is that we aim to keep the private key as secret as possible, just providing a set of methods where the private key is involved.

# AccountHttp usage

```typescript
import {AccountHttp, NEMLibrary, NetworkTypes, Address} from "nem-library";

// Initialize NEMLibrary for TEST_NET Network
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET);

const address = new Address("");

const accountHttp = new AccountHttp();
accountHttp.getFromAddress(address).subscribe(accountInfoWithMetaData => {
    console.log(accountInfoWithMetaData);
});
```


Output:

```

  balance: 
   Balance {
     balance: 50481110745315,
