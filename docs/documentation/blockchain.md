# Blockchain related requests

NEM builds a block chain which contains every bit of information needed. Subsequent blocks in the block chain have increasing heights that differ by one. Each block can contain transactions. Transactions build the basis of all account activity. It is therefore important to understand the concept and the structures of blocks and transactions.

Blocks are generated by accounts. If an account generates a block and the block gets included in the block chain, the generating account, called the harvester, gets all the transaction fees for transactions that are included in the block. A harvester will therefore usually include as many transactions as possible.

Transactions reflect all account activities. In order for a client to have an up to date balance for every account it is crucial to know about every transaction that occurred and therefore the client must have knowledge about every single block in the chain (one says: the client must be synchronized with the block chain).

# BlockHttp definition

```typescript
export declare type BlockHeight = number;

export declare type BlockChainScore = number;

export declare class BlockHttp extends HttpEndpoint {
    constructor(serverConfig?: ServerConfig);

    /**
     * Gets a block from the chain that has a given hash.
     * @param BlockHeight - A BlockHeight JSON object
     * @returns Observable<Block>
     */
    getBlockByHeight(blockHeight: BlockHeight): Observable<Block>;
}

```

# BlockHttp usage

```typescript
import {BlockHttp, NEMLibrary, NetworkTypes} from "nem-library";

// Inicializate NEMLibrary for TEST_NET Network
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET);

const blockHttp = new BlockHttp({domain: "104.128.226.60"});
blockHttp.getBlockByHeight(1033023).subscribe(block => {
    console.log(block);
});
```

Output

```
Block {
  height: 1033023,
  type: 1,
  timeStamp: 72650707,
  prevBlockHash: { data: 'ec766003b1f7ed462ddb5e3bd71d7def7f52cf34aa2ed3f0887bfbeaf59bb77c' },

# ChainHttp definition

```typescript
export declare class ChainHttp extends HttpEndpoint {
    constructor(serverConfig?: ServerConfig);

     * @returns Observable<BlockHeight>
     */
    getBlockchainHeight(): Observable<BlockHeight>;
    /**
     * Gets the current score of the block chain. The higher the score, the better the chain.
     * During synchronization, nodes try to get the best block chain in the network.
     * @returns Observable<BlockChainScore>
     */
    getBlockchainScore(): Observable<BlockChainScore>;
    /**
     * Gets the current last block of the chain.
     * @returns Observable<Block>
     */
    getBlockchainLastBlock(): Observable<Block>;
}


```

# ChainHttp usage

```typescript
import {ChainHttp, NEMLibrary, NetworkTypes} from "nem-library";

// Inicializate NEMLibrary for TEST_NET Network
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET);

const chainHttp = new ChainHttp({domain: "104.128.226.60"});
chainHttp.getBlockchainLastBlock().subscribe(block => {
    console.log(block);
});
```
Output
