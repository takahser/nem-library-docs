The information that can be retrieved is the durable account data, its meta data and information about transactions and harvested blocks.\n\n\nNIS supports two different kind of accounts: normal accounts and multsig (short for: multi signature) accounts:\n\n\nNormal accounts:\n\n\nNormal accounts are created and controlled by a private key. Any action for the account like sending NEM to another account via a transfer transaction is signed with this private key. If an attacker gains knowledge of the private key, he/she can rob the account. The private key must therefore be kept secret by all means.\n\n\nMultisig accounts:\n\n\nMultisig accounts can be created by converting a normal account to a multisig account via a aggregate modification transaction. This adds cosignatories to the account. After that modification, only the cosignatories can initiate an action for the account. Any action must be signed by all cosignatories. This makes a multisig account significantly more secure than a normal account. When a single cosignatory private key is gained by an attacker, the attacker still can`t initiate any action on the account since all cosignatories must sign. It is strongly recommended to convert any account holding a significantly high amount of NEM into a multisig account with at least 3 cosignatories. Once converted to a multisig account, the original private key for the account plays no role any more.\n\n\nOfficial Source\n\n\nKeypair concept\n\n\nNEM Library replaces the Keypair model, which usually holds the public and private key, with the \nAccount\n model. The reason is that we aim to keep the private key as secret as possible, just providing a set of methods where the private key is involved.\n\n\nAccountHttp definition\n\n\nexport declare class AccountHttp extends HttpEndpoint {\n    constructor(nodes?: ServerConfig[]);\n    /**\n     * Gets an AccountInfoWithMetaData for an account.\n     * @param address - Address\n     * @return Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>\n     */\n    getFromAddress(address: Address): Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>;\n    /**\n     * Gets an AccountInfoWithMetaData for an account with publicKey\n     * @param publicKey - NEM\n     * @return Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>\n     */\n    getFromPublicKey(publicKey: string): Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>;\n    /**\n     * Given a delegate (formerly known as remote) account's address, gets the AccountMetaDataPair for the account for which the given account is the delegate account.\n     * If the given account address is not a delegate account for any account, the request returns the AccountMetaDataPair for the given address.\n     * @param address - Address\n     * @return Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>\n     */\n    getOriginalAccountDataFromDelegatedAccountAddress(address: Address): Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>;\n    /**\n     * retrieve the original account data by providing the public key of the delegate account.\n     * @param publicKey - string\n     * @return Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>\n     */\n    getOriginalAccountDataFromDelegatedAccountPublicKey(publicKey: string): Observable<AccountInfoWithMetaData>;\n    /**\n     * Gets the AccountMetaData from an account.\n     * @param address - NEM Address\n     * @return Observable<AccountStatus>\n     */\n    status(address: Address): Observable<AccountStatus>;\n    /**\n     * A transaction is said to be incoming with respect to an account if the account is the recipient of the transaction.\n     * In the same way outgoing transaction are the transactions where the account is the sender of the transaction.\n     * Unconfirmed transactions are those transactions that have not yet been included in a block.\n     * Unconfirmed transactions are not guaranteed to be included in any block\n     * @param address - The address of the account.\n     * @param params\n     */\n    incomingTransactions(address: Address, params?: QueryParams): Observable<Transaction[]>;\n    /**\n     * Paginaged version of incomingTransactions request\n     * @param address\n     * @param params\n     */\n    incomingTransactionsPaginated(address: Address, params?: QueryParams): Pageable<Transaction[]>;\n    /**\n     * Gets an array of transaction meta data pairs where the recipient has the address given as parameter to the request.\n     * A maximum of 25 transaction meta data pairs is returned.

            "text": "This chapter will guide you through the process of retrieving account information from a NEM Infrastructure Server. The information that can be retrieved is the durable account data, its meta data and information about transactions and harvested blocks.  NIS supports two different kind of accounts: normal accounts and multsig (short for: multi signature) accounts:  Normal accounts:  Normal accounts are created and controlled by a private key. Any action for the account like sending NEM to another account via a transfer transaction is signed with this private key. If an attacker gains knowledge of the private key, he/she can rob the account. The private key must therefore be kept secret by all means.  Multisig accounts:  Multisig accounts can be created by converting a normal account to a multisig account via a aggregate modification transaction. This adds cosignatories to the account. After that modification, only the cosignatories can initiate an action for the account. Any action must be signed by all cosignatories. This makes a multisig account significantly more secure than a normal account. When a single cosignatory private key is gained by an attacker, the attacker still can`t initiate any action on the account since all cosignatories must sign. It is strongly recommended to convert any account holding a significantly high amount of NEM into a multisig account with at least 3 cosignatories. Once converted to a multisig account, the original private key for the account plays no role any more.  Official Source",

Once it is included in a block, the transaction gets processed and, in case of a transfer transaction, the amount stated in the transaction gets transferred from the sender's account to the recipient's account. Additionally the transaction fee is deducted from the sender's account. The transaction is said to have 0 confirmations at this point. When another block is added to the block chain the transaction has 1 confirmation. The next block added to the chain will give it 2 confirmations and so on.\n\n\nCrypto currencies have the ability to roll back part the block chain. This is essential for being able to resolve forks of the block chain. There is however a maximum number of blocks that can be rolled back, this is called the rewrite limit. Hence forks can only be resolved up to a certain depth too. NEM has a rewrite limit of 360 blocks. Once a transaction has more than 360 confirmations, it cannot be reversed. In real life, forks that are deeper than 20 blocks do not happen, unless there was some severe problem with the block chain due to a bug in the code or an attack of some kind.\n\n\nOfficial Source\n\n\nTransactionHttp definition\n\n\nexport declare class TransactionHttp extends HttpEndpoint {\n    constructor(nodes?: ServerConfig[]);\n\n    /**\n     * Send the signed transaction\n     * @param transaction\n     * @returns Observable<NemAnnounceResult>\n     */\n    announceTransaction(transaction: SignedTransaction): Observable<NemAnnounceResult>;\n\n    /**\n    * Receive a transaction by its hash\n    * @param {string} hash - transaction hash\n    * @returns Observable<Transaction>\n    */\n    getByHash(hash: string): Observable<Transaction>;\n}\n\n\n\n\nTransactionHttp usage\n\n\nimport {\n    AccountHttp, NEMLibrary, NetworkTypes, Address, Account, TransferTransaction, TimeWindow,\n    EmptyMessage, MultisigTransaction, PublicAccount, TransactionHttp, SignedTransaction\n} from \"nem-library\";\nimport {XEM} from \"nem-library/dist/src/models/mosaic/XEM\";\ndeclare let process: any;\n\n// Initialize NEMLibrary for TEST_NET Network\nNEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET);\n\nconst privateKey: string = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;\nconst multisigAccountPublicKey: string = process.env.MULTISIG_PUBLIC_KEY;\n\nconst cosignerAccount = Account.createWithPrivateKey(privateKey);\n\nconst transferTransaction = TransferTransaction.create(\n    TimeWindow.createWithDeadline(),\n    new Address(\"TCFFOM-Q2SBX7-7E2FZC-3VX43Z-TRV4ZN-TXTCGW-BM5J\"),\n    new XEM(2),\n    EmptyMessage\n);\n\nconst multisigTransaction = MultisigTransaction.create(\n    TimeWindow.createWithDeadline(),\n    transferTransaction,\n    PublicAccount.createWithPublicKey(multisigAccountPublicKey)\n);\n\nconst transactionHttp = new TransactionHttp();\n\nconst signedTransaction: SignedTransaction = cosignerAccount.signTransaction(multisigTransaction);\n\ntransactionHttp.announceTransaction(signedTransaction).subscribe( x => console.log(x));\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\nNemAnnounceResult {\n  type: 1,\n  code: 1,\n  message: 'SUCCESS',\n  transactionHash: { data: '56b4d3e38cb5b707d4b96776116396c2885fd09be6945637f5657204528001b7' },\n  innerTransactionHash: { data: 'a61ce8d0df9aac98ae68e7d88a2f2bb453deb202fd95cf3cf375fde35e4e6794' } }\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the code\n\n\nModels\n\n\nTimeWindow\n\n\nexport declare class TimeWindow {\n    static timestampNemesisBlock: number;\n\n    /**\n     * The deadline of the transaction.

Subsequent blocks in the block chain have increasing heights that differ by one. Each block can contain transactions. Transactions build the basis of all account activity. It is therefore important to understand the concept and the structures of blocks and transactions.\n\n\nBlocks are generated by accounts. If an account generates a block and the block gets included in the block chain, the generating account, called the harvester, gets all the transaction fees for transactions that are included in the block. A harvester will therefore usually include as many transactions as possible.\n\n\nTransactions reflect all account activities.
